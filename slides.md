<!-- 1 min: Opening -->

* Hi - I like rubiks cubes ðŸ‘‹
* Twisting, restickering and permutations are the same creature

---

<!-- 1 min: what is a permutation -->

---

<!-- 1 min: permutations expose a dualism of data and function -->

---

<!-- 1 min: we can combine permutations to get new ones -->

---

<!-- 1 min: we can build rotations to orient the cube -->

---

<!-- 2 min: we can bootstrap lots of permutations from only a handful -->

---

<!-- 2 min: solving a rubiks cube -->
* each position of a cube is itself a permutation
* we search for a sequence of permutations that combines to the solution
* This can be visualised as the exploration of a graph or generating elements from a group

---

<!-- 1 min: search space is large, but we can build partial solutions -->
