[EnthusiastiCon](https://www.enthusiasticon.de/) is a remote conference for the programming community scheduled for `2020-06-06`.
This Repo is the designated location for my talk proposal and subsequent materials.

The [CfP](https://www.enthusiasticon.de/cfp/) was extended to `2020-05-03`, and I've handed in a [proposal](proposal.md) to it.
